Less is more

Made famous by the designer and architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe,
the dictum, Less is More came to define the brave, utopian ideals
of modernist design and architecture. In fact the phrase originated
in Robert Browning's 1855 poem Andrea del Sarto.

Although the postmodernism movement of the Eighties and Nineties
aimed at redefining this notion (one of postmodernism's chief
chroniclers, architect Robert Venturi proclaimed 'Less is a bore' [https://www.archdaily.com/964625/what-is-postmodernism] ,
the original phrase is still used widely today, especially to chasten
artists and designers who may have got carried away with ideas of
their own brilliance.
