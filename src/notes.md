- tdd
  - refactoring, rule of three.
- normally tests different to code since most tests are
  platform specific and dont want to change the code code,
  just the platfrom specific bits
- GH workspaces; unix error conventions

version control

- OSS licenses
- code of conduct
- .gitignore
- standard directors etc docs src test

dialog independence

policy and mechanism 
  - regular expressions
  - doc string
  - data headers

factories (cols)

namespace

functionap programming
- iterators

poymorphism: 
  - delegastion
  - protocls e.g. mid, like,


linux kernel best pracrices
- short release cycles
  - how to make a really short feedback loop
  - link to TDD
- zero internal boundaries
  - everyone uses same tools, config files for those tools in repo
  - e.g. static code tools
