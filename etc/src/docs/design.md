LUA is a "batteries-not-included" language.   But LUA makes it easy to add in the missing bits.
E.g. here are some "b(Ai)tteries" for XAI (explainable artifical intelligence).

## Design
One of the  theres here is that that there the thing we call "data 
mining" shares many of its internal data structures and algorithms
with the thing we call "optimization". So once we build those
internal things, then building "data miners" or "optimizers"
is a  pretty trivial extension. 

Just to demonstrate this, `consider` :
-   `ROWS` holds many `ROW`s (and each `ROW` holds one record).  `ROWS` summarize their numeric
or symbolic  columns in `NUM`s or `SYM`s (respectively). Summaries are held in `COLS`, divided into  (x,y) sets for
independent and dependent columns (respectively). 
- `BIN`s and `SOME` are helper classes. Pairs of (x,y) columns are summarized in `BIN`s. Adjacent `BIN`s with  similar y distributions
are merged. 
`SOME` is a helper
for `NUM`s that holds just some sample of the numerics in that column. 
- Everything else is just tiny extensions to the above object model. e.g. 
  - When clustering, each cluster is its own `ROWS`.
  - `NB` classifiers create one `ROWS` per class in the training data.
  - Decision `TREE`s are built by recursively finding the `BIN`s that best distinguish different `ROW`s. 
  - etc.

As to XAI, this code supports
explaninable semi-supervised multi-objective optimization XAI
(from N items, find and explain the best ones, using just log(N) evals).
- PASS1 (guess): eval two distant items on multi-objective criteria.
       Prune everything nearest the worst one. Recurse on rest.
- PASS2 (guess again): do it again, using better items from first pass.
- PASS3 (explain): recursively discretize attributes on how well they
      distinguish the best and worst items (seen in second pass).
