## Options
For convenience, this code first loads everything from `lib`, then
adds in `the` config table. This means that anyone loading `all`
also can get to all the `lib`.

```lua
local all=require"lib"

```

The `all.opts` function (used here) parses the string to extract
key/value pairs such as  `Min=.5` or `bins=16`. FYI, the `cli`
function (called at start-up in the [go](go.md) file),  checks
for for updates for those keys from the command-line. 

```lua
all.the = all.opts( [[

SHORTr: semi-supervised multi-objective optimization XAI

From N items, find and explain the best ones, using just log(N) evals.
PASS1 (guess): eval two distant items on multi-objective criteria.
      Prune everything nearest the worst one. Recurse on rest.  
PASS2 (guess again): do it again, using better items from first pass.  
PASS3 (explain): recursively discretize attributes on how well they
      distinguish the best and worst items (seen in second pass).
