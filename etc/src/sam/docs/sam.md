If you understand "it", you can code "it" shorter. So while
"it" is longer, recode "it" until "it" is shorter.

Does that work? Does that tactic produce useful results?  Let's check. 

Here's a multi-objective semi-supervised
explanation tool, all in under 300 lines of code (most of
which is background stuff that could be used for other
learners). <br>

`awk '!/^(--|[ \t]*$)/ {n++}`   
`END {print n" lines"}' *.lua`  
=> 231 lines
     
So, what do you think? Like what you see?
