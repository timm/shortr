BAITTERY: semi-supervised multi-objective optimization XAI
(c) 2022 Tim Menzies <timm@ieee.org> BSD2 license
     
From N items, find and explain the best ones, using just log(N) evals.
PASS1 (guess): eval two distant items on multi-objective criteria.
      Prune everything nearest the worst one. Recurse on rest.  
PASS2 (guess again): do it again, using better items from first pass.  
PASS3 (explain): recursively discretize attributes on how well they
      distinguish the best and worst items (seen in second pass).
