<em>"Dr. Hoenikker used to say that any scientist<br>
     who couldn't explain to an eight-year-old <br>
     what he was doing was a charlatan."<br></em>-   Kurt Vonnegut, Cat's Cradle

<em>"If you cannot - in the long run - (explain to)<br>
    everyone what you have been doing,<br>
    your doing  has been worthless."</em><br>- Erwin Schrodinger

   
AI and XAI (explainable artificial intelligence) need not be
hard.  E.g. here's a few hundred lines of LUA
to search N items to  find and explain the best ones, using just
log(N) evals.
