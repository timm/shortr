Do I understand "it"?
Can I code "it" succinctly? Using simple tools and a minimal set of data 
structure and algorithms? Does "it" do the minimum work  (so"it" runs fast)?
 Can I explain "it" to you, quickly and successfully? And does "it" generalize
(so "it" is not a one-off hack)?<p>Let's check. Please review my code.   
This is  a multi-objective semi-supervised explanation tool,
all in under 400 lines of code
 (most of which is background stuff that could be used for other learners).
