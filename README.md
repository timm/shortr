Write the _most_ learners in the _least_ code.
Each learner should be few lines of code (since they share an 
underlying code base).  
     
Why LUA? Four reasons. 

__ONE__:<br>LUA supports simple teaching
(less than 2 dozen keywords). Heck, children use it to code up their own games.

__TWO__:<br>LUA supports many advanced programming
techniques (first class
objects, functional programming, etc) without  (**L**ots of (**I**nfuriating (**S**illy
(**P**arenthesis)))).  For example, the entire object system used here is just five lines of code
(see **is()**). 

__THREE__:<br>The other great secret is that, at their core, many of these
learners is essential simple. So by coding up those algorithms, in just a few
lines of LUA, we are teaching students that AI is something they can understand
and improve.
   
__FOUR__:<br>This code is a succinct executable specification that demonstrates 
numerous recommended coding practices (for learning and for scripting).
It supports my standard assignment is "here is  a worked solution,
now code it up in any other language". So I can give students a worked solution,
and then can still code in their language du jour.
