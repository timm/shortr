 <b>Tony Hoare:</b><br>
<em>"Inside every large program is a small program struggling to get out."</em><p>
<b>Alan Perlis:</b><br><em>"Simplicity does not precede complexity, but follows it."</em><p>
<b>Dieter Rams:</b><br><em>"Less, but better."</em>

Now that you've done _it_, can you do _it_ better? Did you really understand _it_?
Can you now
write _it_ in fewer lines and do you know how to make _it_ run faster?
Can you teach _it_ quickly to newcomers?
And can you generalize _it_ such that _it_ can be quickly
adapted to other purposes?

E.g. do I understand a multi-objective semi-supervised explanation?
Well, maybe. Here's all that, most of which is
background stuff that could be used for other learners.  
Once
I build that, I found that decision trees, Naive Bayes classifiers,
and nearest neighbors were all tiny extensions. 
Also included here
is literate programming, self-documenting code and support for
test-driven development. 

All in around 300 lines of LUA: <br>

`awk '!/^(--|[ \t]*$)/{n++} END {print n" lines"}' *.lua`   => 301 lines
     
Share and enjoy.
