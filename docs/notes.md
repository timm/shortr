surprise: doco and tests take a large percent of the work


beware log(0) and hi==lo


surprises
- Col is a primary thing
- Data is a thing. cloning. reporting. clistering = make recursive tables

iit comes with maths (sampling). it comes with knowledge of humans (cognitive theory)
it comes wih v&v out ofthe box. it comes with explanaintion and oversight.

sampling: the larger the sample, the less we keep (reservoir)

self-documentating code:

- Makefile
- sting text

have to get the 5 laws in here somehow

the important thing here is not the specific ai algorithms but the infrastructure around it. if we do word counts on this code base and count
how many line are specific to (e.g.)  knn or naive bayes etc , the interesting pattern is that most of the code
is NOT specific. that is this code is a worknecnhu of N lines of code within which it is fast to assemble a NB (10 lines) or a KNN (12 lines)
.

better yet, with when software contains many small utilities that share the same (much larger) underling infrastructure,
then it becomes easy to mix and match more; i.e. to combine parts of this and parts of that according to your whims
or the needs of the next problem.



Less is more

Made famous by the designer and architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe,
the dictum, Less is More came to define the brave, utopian ideals
of modernist design and architecture. In fact the phrase originated
in Robert Browning's 1855 poem Andrea del Sarto.

https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43745/andrea-del-sarto

Although the postmodernism movement of the Eighties and Nineties
aimed at redefining this notion (one of postmodernism's chief
chroniclers, architect Robert Venturi proclaimed 'Less is a bore' [https://www.archdaily.com/964625/what-is-postmodernism] ,
the original phrase is still used widely today, especially to chasten
artists and designers who may have got carried away with ideas of
their own brilliance.

- tdd
  - refactoring, rule of three.
- tests different to code since most tests are
  platform specific and dont want to change the code code,
  just the platfrom specific bits
- GH workspaces; unix error conventions

version control

- OSS licenses
- code of conduct
- .gitignore
- standard directors etc docs src test

  - regular expressions
  - doc string
  - data headers

  - delegastion
  - protocls e.g. mid, like,


linux kernel best pracrices
- short release cycles
  - how to make a really short feedback loop
  - link to TDD
- zero internal boundaries
  - everyone uses same tools, config files for those tools in repo
  - e.g. static code tools
