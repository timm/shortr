<b>Tony Hoare:</b><br>
<em>"Inside every large program is a small program struggling to get out."</em><p>
<b>Alan Perlis:</b><br><em>"Simplicity does not precede complexity, but follows it."</em><p>
<b>Dieter Rans:</b><br><em>"Less, but better."</em>

Now that you've done "it", can you do "it" better? Did you really understand "it"?
Can you now
write "it" in fewer lines and do you know how to make "it" run faster?
Can you teach "it" quickly to newcomers?
And can you generalize "it" such that "it" can be quickly
adapted to other purposes?

E.g. do I understand a multi-objective semi-supervised explanation?
Well, maybe. Here's all that, most of which is
background stuff that could be used for other learners.  

Once
I build that, I found that decision trees, Naive Bayes classifiers,
and nearest neighbors were all tiny extensions. 

Also included here
is literate programming, self-documenting code and support for
test-driven development. 

All in around 300 lines of LUA: <br>

`awk '!/^(--|[ \t]*$)/ {n++}`   
`END {print n" lines"}' *.lua`  
=> 301 lines
     
Share and enjoy.
