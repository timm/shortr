Now that you've done _it_, did you really understand _it_? Let's check.

Can you do _it_ better?
Can you now
write _it_ in fewer lines and do you know how to make _it_ run faster?
Can you see how _it_ is same/different to other things?
And can you use those similarities to do more things with  _it_?
Finally, can you teach _it_ quickly to newcomers?

E.g. do I understand a multi-objective semi-supervised explanation algorithms?
Well, Let's check. 

Here's all that, most of which is background stuff
that could be used for other learners.  Once I build that, I found
that decision trees, Naive Bayes classifiers, and nearest neighbors
were all tiny extensions.  Also included here is literate programming,
self-documenting code and support for test-driven development.

All in around 300 lines of LUA: <br>

`awk '!/^(--|[ \t]*$)/{n++}`     
`END {print n" lines"}' *.lua`  
=> 301 lines
